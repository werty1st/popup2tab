I modified it because some Multimessenger Addons don't load from a "chrome://extensions/" URL anymore. As result they where captured by the original plugin and converted to a Tab.

This causes the messengers to lose the ability to create their own taskbar icon for faster and easier access.

## Github
_Because I coudn't find a public github repository of the original extension, to file a merge request, i created a new one._




# Usage

The updated version is able to switch between blacklist and whitelist mode.

### Blacklist Mode

The default setting is the blacklist mode. All Popups are converted to Tabs.

If you want to disable that behavior disable the switch on that specific site.
* ![](/screen/option1.png =500x)

### Whitelist Mode

You can use the options to switch to the whitelist mode.
* ![](/screen/option2.png =500x)

All new popups are untouched until specifically enabled.
* ![](/screen/option3.png =500x)

Page whitelisted
* ![](/screen/option4.png =500x)
